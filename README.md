## Lab 1 - Maze Generator
In this notebook, we generate N x N mazes by using the Randomized Depth-First Search (Iterative Implementation) and we use search arlgorithms (Dijkstra, Best-First Search and A*) with heuristic functions (Manhattan and Euclidean) to find the shortest path. Also, we stimulate a chase inside the maze between a player and a ghost, by using the Alpha-Beta Algorithm. 


## Lab2 - Movie Recommender in Prolog

All notebook reports are in Greek language.
